## Background

### Refining the luxury tone of voice.

East 63 is a high end residential building in Melbourne CBD. Because it is set in a luxury precinct and is focused on appealing to either a strategic, asset focused or legacy focused buyer, it makes sense to look to the luxury brands in the east to draw inspiration from and to align East63 with those brands via positive connotation.

**Paris, New York, London.** These cities are shaped by their culture, luxury brands, and most importantly by their renowned buildings. East Sixty Three is a development opportunity that can never be repeated, and one which will leave an indelible mark on Melbourne in its leafy East end. JLL are pleased to present the upcoming sale of 63 Exhibition Street, Melbourne.

Unrivalled in exclusivity, location, design and potential cultural relevance, the 52 floor building will turn heads and attract residents and guests from the world over. Inspired by hotels and residencies of significance around the world, East Sixty Three will join their ranks and set a new benchmark for elegance and quality with its legacy.

Elevated Eastern Elegance.

A building that is the last of its kind must leave the most exceptional legacy.

East Sixty Three is about to make its mark on Melbourne’s landscape with a never to be repeated permit, and a height of 182.6m. It is a rare opportunity, as it is one of just 4 buildings between 5,000 and 20,000 sqm in the Eastern Core. It will soar to 52 floors comprising both residential and hotel suites. The simple yet notable design reflects the sunlight to dazzle and impress.
