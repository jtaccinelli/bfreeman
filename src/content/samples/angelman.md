## Background

### Growing voices from 1,700 to 500k

The goal of this outreach is to inform patients with Angelman Syndrome about the power of their data for clinical research, and to advocate for a cure. It's a hard sell to convince people that a boring form can change the world.

## Samples

### Example 1: Registry Landing Page

_“When the whole world is silent, even one voice becomes powerful.”_ – Malala Yousafzia.

A voice speaking alone is quiet.

A thousand voices is a roar.

500,000 people are estimated to have Angelman Syndrome worldwide.

Imagine the power our voices have when we speak together.

Today, we’re asking you to amplify your voice.

To many of us, a data set might seem boring, even pointless. A series of answers to survey questions can’t change the world, or cure a disease – right?

_There’s more to the story._

Data is what got us to the moon. Data is what has allowed us to develop cancer treatments. Data demonstrates how many people need a cure. Data is set to revolutionise healthcare as we know it. To us scientists, your data is gold. Your data is your story. If a picture is worth a thousand words, your answers to our survey are worth a cure.

Let us say that again: **your data is your voice.**

It is impossibly hard to live with a rare disease, and even harder when the person suffering is your beloved child. Before the internet, parents of children with a rare disease often had to go through their experience alone – but not anymore. For the first time in human history, you can join voices with every other patient worldwide, and you can be heard together.

We need more people from around the world to sign up to the Registry so that we can report accurate figures of those with Angelman Syndrome and advocate for a cure.
