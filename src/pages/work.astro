        <p>
          As you will see, my work experience is wide-ranging - which is just
          how I like it. I have spent over 5 years developing my portfolio as a
          freelance writer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand the real-world applications behind the marketing
          strategies that I execute via content. I can jump into an array of
          industries, apply a variety of communications skills, and rapidly
          create effective communications strategies, copy and assets with
          confidence, creativity and flair.
