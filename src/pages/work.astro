      <p>
        As you will see, my work experience is wide-ranging - which is just how
        I like it. I have spent over 5 years developing my portfolio as a
        freelance writer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand the real-world applications behind the marketing strategies
        that I execute via content. I can jump into an array of industries,
        apply a variety of communications skills, and rapidly create effective
        communications strategies, copy and assets with confidence, creativity
        and flair.
