          I am based in Brisbane, but I work with companies all over Australia
          to refine their tone of voice and provide creative and high-quality
          content with a personal touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please feel free to peruse my work and see what strikes your fancy. I
          look forward to hearing from you!
